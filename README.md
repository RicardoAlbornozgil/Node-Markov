# Markov Machine
## Introduction


A Markov machine, often referred to as a Markov chain or Markov model, is a mathematical system used to model random processes where the future 
state depends only on the current state and not on the sequence of events that preceded it. In simpler terms, it's a way of predicting the next 
step in a sequence of events based solely on the current step, assuming that the future is independent of the past given the present. This makes 
it a useful tool for analyzing and simulating a wide range of phenomena, from natural language processing to financial markets and biological systems.

In practical terms, a Markov machine consists of a set of states and transition probabilities between these states. These probabilities are 
usually represented in a matrix called the transition matrix. By analyzing this matrix and the current state, one can predict the probabilities 
of transitioning to each possible next state. Markov machines find applications in various fields, such as text generation, speech recognition, 
weather forecasting, and even in modeling the behavior of complex systems like the stock market or biological systems.


## Features
  * __Text Generation:__ Create random text based on the patterns observed in the input text.
  * __Command-Line Interface:__ Easily interact with the Markov Machine through a command-line interface for text generation from files or URLs.
  * __Modular Design:__ The codebase is designed with modularity in mind, making it easy to extend and customize for specific use cases.
  * Dependency Management:__ Utilizes npm for managing dependencies and ensuring easy installation and setup.

## Getting Started

### Installation

The Markov Machine can be used via the command line to generate text from either a file or a URL.
### Usage
```bash
node makeText.js file <path>
```
To generate text from a URL:
```bash
node makeText.js url <path>
```
### Examples

```bash
node makeText.js file example.txt
```

```bash
node makeText.js url https://example.com/
```
